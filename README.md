# ToxDialog
An alternative of a Message Box, based on VDialog

Sometimes you need a more flexible MessageBox in .Net, I know I do. Some years ago I found one that suited me, called VDialog (I am trying to find the original source for reference).
I converted it to C# and made some small improvements as well.

A more detailed description and a demo project will follow, but that can take a while. Just as a caution, it is not an actual MessageBox, it is a Dialog/Form. So, this cannot be called as a MessageBox.

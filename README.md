# ToxDialog
An alternative of a Message Box, based on VDialog

Sometimes you need a more flexible MessageBox in .Net, I know I do. Some years ago I found one that suited me, called VDialog (https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/21225/VDialog-Vista-TaskDialog-for-Windows-XP).
I converted it to C# and made some small improvements and changes as well. It is based on the last standalone version of VDialog.

A more detailed description and a demo project will follow, but that can take a while. Just as a caution, it is not an actual MessageBox, it is a Dialog/Form. You can call as a MessageBox though. For more control, create it as a dialog.

Currently English and Dutch are supported. If you want another language, please sent in a commit or sent the translations to me. The Excel sheet in the root gives all the language strings currently in the project and the current translations.
